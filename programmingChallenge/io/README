These tests are extremely difficult to generate manually
The provided file testMaker.cpp created all tests in this directory, but some were modified to be more interesting and explore edge cases
Additionally, testMaker2.cpp was used to make extra cases with a different form. Some internal values were modified and not saved to generate the cases.

./testMaker takes 0 or 4 command line paramters being a, b, p, and u in order as defined by the writeup
If no arguments are given, the default is the max size, which is far too large to push to git
./testMaker also takes a filename from stdin, which it writes the expected result to

New tests can be created by running the following commands

make
./testMaker a b p u > test.in.X
test.out.X

OR

make
./testMaker > test.in.X
test.out.X

These may segfault / the output might be incorrect.
All test cases used and numbered are verified, but new test cases made may not be
