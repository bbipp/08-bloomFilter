These tests are extremely difficult to generate manually
The provided file testMaker.cpp created all tests in this directory, but some were modified to be more interesting and explore edge cases

./testMaker takes 0 or 4 command line paramters being a, b, p, and u in order as defined by the writeup
If no arguments are given, the default is the max size, which is far too large to push to git
./testMaker also takes a filename from stdin, which it writes the expected result to

New tests can be created by running the following commands

make
./testMaker a b p u > test.in.X
test.out.X

OR

make
./testMaker > test.in.X
test.out.X
