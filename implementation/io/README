testMaker.cpp was used to generate all tests in this directory, and can be used to generate arbitrary sized test cases.
It takes input from stdin in the form of two integers
 - the first is the number of values to be added to the bloom filter
 - the second is the number of values that are going to be tested against the bloom filter

We ran into issues with test case size, so sample 4 is provided as input to this file.
It can be created by running the following:

make
./testMaker < in.sample.in.4 > sample.in.4
(NOTE: this may crash your editor and takes up about 1 GB. It also takes a very long time to run in python)

The last two lines of this file will contain the expected output
